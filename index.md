# Data Science And Machine Learning Portfolio

A Digital Portfolio of all my Projects related to DS & ML

## Falcon9-Landing-Prediction

I have predicted, if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or not using several Machine Learning Models. SpaceX advetises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This informtion can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
