## Falcon9-Landing-Prediction

I have predicted, if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or not using several Machine Learning Models. SpaceX advetises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This informtion can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Stock Market Prediction

Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis
Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines. Stock to analyze and predict SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX) Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6 Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model.

## Lending Club Case Study

The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) . Thus, we have to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## Analyzing the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix with the Fast F1 library
Accessing Formula -1 Race's historical data using Python. As mentioned earlier, the F1 race weekends generate a lot of data. Every car has 150 to 300 sensors on average, with the engine alone having close to 50 sensors. It is estimated that around 300GB of data per car is generated each Grand Prix weekend. This mind-boggling data contains immense valuable information. Careful analysis of this data can provide a competitive advantage to teams over others even before the car hits the track.
