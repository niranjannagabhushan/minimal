## Falcon9-Landing-Prediction

I have predicted, if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or not using several Machine Learning Models. SpaceX advetises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This informtion can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Lending Club Case Study

The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) . Thus, we have to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
